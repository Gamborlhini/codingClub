## The Purpose of this Repository
This repository is meant to host a website which will highlight our coding club's highlights and projects. The hope is that our members will eventually be able to work on the website and contribute their own projects and accomplishments to it.

## Collaboration Expectations
I've put the following collaboration expectations here just so everyone knows how to work with the website and to make sure that if we temporarily mess something up, it doesn't cause issues with the published website.
* **Never directly edit the master branch**
  * This is important because the master branch is what is (or will be) published as a website. Always make a copy of the branch in one way or another and then submit a pull request to merge into the master
* Please wait for someone to review your pull request, especially if you are a beginner to the Web Development stack.
* Try and document your code as well as possible. This will greatly help people trying to review pull requests and also help for readability in the future.
  * It's always better to write code that explains itself, especially concerning variable names. Write good variable names, not just single letters or random strings.
